- Brute Force Attack (XL-SIEM alarm - > we should add the user name identification
                                    - > RAE raising alarm (we need to check the risk analysis because it was not calculating correctly the overall risk)
                                    - > EDC suggesting to block IP or user… at least the user :))

- Malicious URL (XL-SIEM alarm - > not detecting the way it was being done by Eurico, I recall that what was decided was:
If the http request registered in log of the SAP Web dispatcher server do not include one of the following strings in the URL path
1/HttpAdapter/
2/XISOAPAdapter/
3/RESTAdapter/
4/AS2/
5/AdapterMessageMonitoring/basic
6/AdapterFramework/ChannelAdminServlet
Or if it is an access to an administration URL that does not come from an internal network – meaning, that has different Ips from the following list – then it a potential exploit attempt:
              10.13.xxx.xxx
              10.208.xxx.xxx
              10.36.xxx.xxx
              10.30.xxx.xxx
              10.31.xxx.xxx
Then RAE raising alarm (here what part of the risk analysis should be raised?) - > EDC suggesting to block IP (via IRO)

- Denial of service (XL-SIEM alarm - > RAE raising alarm (again, check the risk analysis in this case) - > EDC suggesting to block IP (via IRO)

- Unauthorized access - > EDC suggesting to block mac address (via IRO)
